This reposiroty is for personal experimentation.  It's where I'll by
trying to implement the exercises from [[http://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki-ebook/dp/B00AKE1V04][Purely Functional Data
Structures]] by Chris Okasaki.

I'm attempting to implement all these without using anything from the
scala standard library, so I'm implementing my own type to replace
Option, List, Stream, etc. My versions of these types will all be
invariant instead of covariant.
